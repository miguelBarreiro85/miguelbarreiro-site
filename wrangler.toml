# This is a static site configuration for Cloudflare Pages
# Pages projects don't use traditional Workers configuration
# but this file can help with local development via Wrangler

# For Cloudflare Pages deployment:
# 1. The build output directory should be set to the root or a public folder
# 2. No build command needed since this is a pure static site
# 3. All static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) will be served directly

# If you want to use Wrangler dev for local testing
# Run: wrangler pages dev ./public
